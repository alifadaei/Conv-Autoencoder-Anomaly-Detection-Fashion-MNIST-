# Conv Autoencoder Anomaly Detection (Fashion-MNIST) — Portfolio Project

A compact, research-style deep learning project demonstrating **unsupervised anomaly detection**
with a **Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)**.

## Idea
Train a CAE to reconstruct only “normal” data (one class).  
At test time, samples that reconstruct poorly are treated as **anomalies**.

## What’s inside
- Convolutional Autoencoder (PyTorch)
- Train on one “normal” class, others as anomalies
- Threshold selection (Youden’s J)
- ROC-AUC + PR-AUC + confusion matrix
- Visualizations: reconstructions, error histograms, top anomalies

## Files
- `CAE_Anomaly_FashionMNIST.ipynb`
- `README.md`
- `requirements.txt`

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom.
